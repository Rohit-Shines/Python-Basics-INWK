# Task 2: Modify your program from the previous exercise to read the book you downloaded and process the rest of the
# words as before. A. Then modify the program to count the total number of words in the book, and the number of times
# each word is used. B. print the 20 most frequently-used words in the book. C. Print the number of different words
# used in the book Optional: write a function that takes in any number of books and produce the book with the
# greatest number of words
