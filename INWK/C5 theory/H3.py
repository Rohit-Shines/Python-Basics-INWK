# Objective: To understand SD-WAN process through Python programing. Proposed date of completion is coming Friday.
# Background: In conventional WAN links, the secondary transport link (Link B) usually sits idle without any traffic using it until Link A fails. With SD-WAN, options of application load-balancing over multiple links in a hybrid environment becomes possible. Hybrid WAN approach is enabled that uses bandwidth from both links as an A + A or an Active/Active scenario. Various options are possible for example weighted per-session round-robin is also configurable, application pinning, or forcing an application to take a specific transport. An application-aware routing or SLA-compliant routing for jitter, loss, and delay can be therefore implemented. An SLA determines if the application is adhering to that policy, and performing properly, or if it is experiencing some sort of detriment such as jitter, loss, or delay. Then application can be routed to another transport that will ensure SLA compliance
# Proposed Scenario:
# A scenario such as the following with some exceptions. You can avoid having a vManage that connects to the remote sites to avoid teaching student to connect the central control to the remote sites. Instead, the programs you write will work on remote sites.
