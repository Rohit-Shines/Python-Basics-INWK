# Q1:
# It could be a sender or a receiver. If a sender, it will give options to users to select a value of μ
# and will draw a linear as well as non-linear graph for the selected value of μ.
# If it is a receiver, it will read what value of μ is on the graph (check what is non-linearity),
# expand it by putting μ =0, and draw both non-linear based on μ you determined from the graph
# and the expanded (uniform) linear pattern after putting μ = 0.
# The formula is:
